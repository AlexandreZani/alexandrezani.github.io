Today, I found myself craving chocolate hazelnut butter. I don't do Nutella
anymore because of how sweet it is. I usually have Justin's. But while I like
what they do, I was curious if I could make something that I would like even
more. I'm not sure I like this one more, but it's at least as good and I can
try tweaks to see if I can improve.

## Recipe ##
Warning: I actually measured nothing so those are estimates

#### Ingredients ####

- 4 cups of unsalted roasted hazelnuts. (I could not find raw ones)
- 1 cup of raw unsalted almonds. (I needed to free up a container)
- 2 oz of 70% dark chocolate. (Scharffenberger's baking bar)
- 1-2 tablespoons of honey

#### Process ####

- This recipe was dependent upon the awesome power of the Vitamix.
- Toss in all the nuts and slowly crank up the speed to max. (Give it a break to cool down every once in a while so you don't burn the nuts)
- When the nut butter is flowing, toss in the chocolate.
- Finally, add in honey until you like the taste.

Recipes online recommended some Canola oil, but I tried without and it worked.
