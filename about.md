I'm a software engineer who likes math, cooking, reading and other things.

It should go without saying but this is a personal blog and should not be
interpreted as reflecting the opinions of my employer. Except regarding chocolate
that is. I do speak for Google when I say that chocolate is delicious. But that's it.

If you need to reach me, try Twitter or you can email me at {{ site.email }}.
